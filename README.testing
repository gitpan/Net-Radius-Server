Test cases include so called "interactive" tests. These tests require
an external application (LDAP server, PAM setup, RADIUS server) in
order to complete.

As this is not always available, you must enable the tests
specifically by setting the value of the environment variable
$NRS_INTERACTIVE to a true value. Something like this, works in a bash
shell:

export NRS_INTERACTIVE=1

You will be required to supply a number of arguments to the test
scripts in order to complete them.
